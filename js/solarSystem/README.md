![alt text](https://github.com/alevalenti44/Solar-System-THREE.js/blob/master/planets.gif)

Using THREE.js's raycasting I was able to get the name of the name of the object where the user clicks (the object name in this case being the planet's name), and create a URL to open a wikipedia page of the planet that has been clicked on.

### How to Install:

`git clone https://github.com/alevalenti44/Solar-System-THREE.js`

` npm install http-server -g`

`http-server`
